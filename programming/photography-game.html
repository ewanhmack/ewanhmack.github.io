                <p>I created a procedurally generated island with 4 different biomes. So far there is no aim to my game, apart from wondering around and taking photos of your surroundings</p>
                <br>
                <p>You have the basic WASD controls, pressing rmb to enter the camera viewfinder and the ability to zoom in and out with the scroll wheel</p>
                <br>
                <p>All of the photos you take in game are stored within the unreal file, and in the future i plan to add an ingame portfolio system that will allow the user to view all of the photos they have taken</p>

                <p>The blueprint script I created to zoom the camera into the viewfinder. When rmb is clicked once it enters the viewfinder and stays there until rmb is clicked again.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Currently it does this by moving the camera 50 units forward in the x direction, dependant on the direction the user is facing. I plan to change this system so that it uses a camera arm instead</p>
